<h2>What Information We Collect</h2>

<h3>Information You Provide</h3>
<p>When you create or use an account in Quizlo, we may collect:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Account information:</strong> display name (username), email address (if you sign in with Google and permit sharing), avatar choice.</li>
  <li><strong>Authentication data:</strong> Google Sign-In identifiers, anonymous account identifiers (if you play anonymously), account linking metadata.</li>
  <li><strong>User-generated content:</strong> profile settings, optionally shared result cards, and any text or media you choose to submit publicly (for example when posting to leaderboards or sharing results).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Automatically Collected / Usage Data</h3>
<p>We automatically collect information about your Device and how you use the App, including but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Device model and operating system</li>
  <li>Unique device identifiers</li>
  <li>IP address (may be used for geolocation at country level)</li>
  <li>App usage data (game mode, questions answered, scores, streaks, coins earned/spent)</li>
  <li>Crash reports and diagnostics</li>
  <li>Analytics events (to understand feature usage and improve the App)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Data Stored in Game Systems</h3>
<p>
  Quizlo stores game-related data (scores, leaderboards, achievements, coin balances and daily challenge progress) in our backend (Firestore). Scores and selected profile fields (display name, avatar) may be visible publicly in leaderboard screens.
</p>

<h3>No Contacts Access (Unless You Grant It)</h3>
<p>
  Quizlo does not access your device contacts by default. If in a future update we add features that request access to contacts, we will ask for explicit permission and update this policy accordingly.
</p>

<h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
<p>We use Personal Data for purposes including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Providing and operating the App (authentication, account management, offline caching)</li>
  <li>Maintaining leaderboards, profiles, and game progress</li>
  <li>Serving and measuring ads, and managing rewarded ads for hints/features</li>
  <li>Analytics and improvements (to understand usage, fix bugs, and improve features)</li>
  <li>Communicating with you for account or support matters (where you provide contact details)</li>
  <li>Fraud prevention and security</li>
</ul>

<h2>Advertising &amp; Personalization</h2>
<p>
  Quizlo displays advertisements (banner, interstitial, rewarded) using third-party ad networks such as Google AdMob. Those networks may collect information about your device and app usage to deliver and personalize ads.
</p>
<h4>What data may be used for ads</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Non-personal data: device model, OS version, app usage events, anonymous identifiers</li>
  <li>Personal data: if you’ve provided identifiers (e.g., email) and the ad network’s policies permit using them for personalization</li>
</ul>
<p>
  You can opt out of interest-based advertising through your device settings and the ad networks' opt-out tools (for example Google Ads Settings). Opting out may reduce ad personalization but will not necessarily eliminate all ads.
</p>

<h2>Third-Party Services &amp; Links</h2>
<p>
  We use third-party services to run portions of the App (Firebase for auth &amp; database, OpenTDB for trivia content, analytics providers, and ad networks). Each third party has its own privacy practices. We encourage you to review their privacy policies.
</p>

<h2>OpenTDB &amp; Question Content</h2>
<p>
  Quizlo fetches quiz questions from OpenTDB and caches them locally for offline play. OpenTDB’s content is publicly sourced; we do not claim ownership of that content. Questions are cached for performance and offline availability (cache expiry policy described below).
</p>

<h2>Data Retention</h2>
<p>We retain personal data only for as long as necessary for the purposes set out in this policy:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Account data:</strong> retained while your account is active and for up to 24 months following account deletion or inactivity, unless otherwise required by law.</li>
  <li><strong>Usage &amp; analytics data:</strong> retained for up to 24 months for product improvement and fraud detection.</li>
  <li><strong>Cached questions:</strong> stored locally and refreshed from the API periodically (default cache expiry: 7 days).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Your Rights</h2>
<p>
  Depending on where you live, you may have rights including to access, correct, export, or delete personal data we hold about you. To exercise these rights, contact us at the email below. We will respond in accordance with applicable law.
</p>

<h2>Sharing &amp; Disclosure</h2>
<p>We may disclose Personal Data in the following circumstances:</p>
<ul>
  <li>To Service Providers who help operate the App (hosting, analytics, ads, customer support)</li>
  <li>To comply with legal obligations or respond to lawful requests from public authorities</li>
  <li>In connection with a business transfer (sale, merger) — we will notify users if ownership changes</li>
  <li>With your consent (for example, when you choose to share a results card or post to a public leaderboard)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Public Areas &amp; Leaderboards</h2>
<p>
  Leaderboards display limited profile details (display name/username, rank, score, accuracy) and are publicly viewable within the App. Do not enter personal information into your display name if you do not want it visible to others.
</p>

<h2>Security</h2>
<p>
  We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your information (encryption in transit, secure storage on trusted third-party platforms). However, no system is 100% secure — we cannot guarantee absolute security.
</p>

<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>
  The App is not intended for children under 16 and we do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under 16. If you believe we have collected information from a child under 16, please contact us and we will take steps to delete the data.
</p>

<h2>International Transfers</h2>
<p>
  Data may be processed in countries other than your own (for example where our cloud providers operate). Where required, we implement appropriate safeguards for cross-border transfers.
</p>

<h2>Cookies &amp; Local Storage</h2>
<p>
  The App uses local device storage and cookies (or equivalent) for caching, session persistence, and offline support. You can clear local data via your device settings or in-app account deletion (where supported).
</p>

<h2>How to Delete or Correct Your Data</h2>
<p>
  To request deletion, correction, or export of your Personal Data, please contact us at <a href="mailto:rcelabslimited@gmail.com">rcelabslimited@gmail.com</a>. We may ask for proof of identity to process requests and will respond in accordance with applicable law. Some data may remain in backups or logs for a short period.
